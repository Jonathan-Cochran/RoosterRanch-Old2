<b>IT ALL STARTED WHENâ€¦</b>
<br/>
The company had made multiple decisions to proceed with projects that 'felt' like they would create a large return on investment. 
However, after many months of aligning on requirements and developing the features the return was not there. This drove business and IT 
to partner together on a better approach.

<br/>
We created a small team focused on running tests that would allow us to use actual users data to determine the potential value of features
before implementing larger projects. We took an MVP approach with the tests to allow us to move fast and drive towards data driven decisions.

We were able to deliver many tests for the product. We typically had 3 - 5 tests running in production at any given time. 
Below are just a couple of examples that lead to future project / feature development.

Test: This was a simple test to display the same 'Get a Quote' button with different colors for 50% of the traffic on the landing page 
of the product. The theroy was that a more -
